# Link Shortener

This project is a simple (and naive) implementation of an API that handles (and serves, Soonâ„¢) shorthand versions of relatively big URLs (yes, it's a bit.ly clone).

I started this project as a way to study more about the implementations of servers and see how things that are taken for granted in big frameworks function under the hood.
